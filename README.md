Recently I start to  learn React and develope this sample To-Do List Website in React.<br>

## Demo

_The To-Do list template designed and shared by [Hexschool(六角學院)](https://hexschool.github.io/THE_F2E_Design/todolist/)_

## Function

1. It is able to record daily todo tasks.
2. It can set the priority of every task. (default status is none)
3. It is free to change the order of the items by dragging.
4. Every single task can set time alert and leave comments.
5. The status of each todo has all tasks, in progress, completed.

## What I learned from this project

- [x] Store todo items in localStorage
- [x] Multiple checkbox / toggle state
- [x] Handle form in React with uncontrolled & controlled components
- [x] Render each list based on their task status
- [x] Most important task is at the top of the page
- [x] Drag and drop to change order of task items

## Installation

2. Run `npm install`

## Development

2. `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
