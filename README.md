# React ToDoList 

Recently I start to  learn React and develope this sample To-Do List Website in React.<br>
This web is with three task types, all tasks, in progress and completed.

## Demo

_The To-Do list template designed and shared by [Hexschool(六角學院)](https://hexschool.github.io/THE_F2E_Design/todolist/)_

## What I learned from this project

- [x] Store todo items in localStorage
- [x] Multiple checkbox / toggle state
- [x] Handle form in React with uncontrolled & controlled components
- [x] Render each list based on their task status
- [x] Most important task is at the top of the page
- [x] Drag and drop to change order of task items

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`

## Development

1. `npm start`: Run the app in development mode.
2. `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
